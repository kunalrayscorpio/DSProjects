In 9/16 , he presented to the emergency room with wide\\ncomplex tachycardia requiring electrical cardioversion at the\\nJoadi Community Hospital .  During the admission in 1998 , the\\npatient had a catheterization which revealed proximal , an occluded proximal descending artery off his right\\ncoronary artery , normal hemodynamics , anteroseptal hypokinesis ,\\ninferior hypokinesis , apical thrombus , and aneurysm with an EF of\\n50%. An EP study revealed 27 and 22 beat runs of nonsustained\\nV-tach with left bundle branch block inducible after three\\nventricular extra stimuli during ventricular drive pacing at 400\\nmsec.

During this ETT , his blood pressure actually\\nfell from 125 to 85 systolic and his EKG revealed 1 mm ST\\ndepression in the limb leads. Therefore , on 8/5/93 , he was\\nadmitted to the Eredrens Recraw University Of Medical Center and underwent cardiac\\ncatheterization , which revealed 100% LAD and RCA occlusion , 60%\\nproximal ramus stenosis , and left ventriculogram revealed anterior\\nhypokinesis , inferior hypokinesis , and apical dyskinesis with an\\nejection fraction of 48%. The decision was then made during his\\n1/16 admission to proceed with surgical revascularization. During\\nhis admission , he underwent a three vessel coronary artery bypass\\ngraft with LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein graft to the right\\ncoronary artery and proximal descending artery , with endarterectomy\\nto the proximal descending artery.
